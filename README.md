Welcome to **coal**, a repository dedicated to assembly-level programming for the x86 architecture. This repository serves as a collection of examples, tutorials, and practical code snippets to help understand and implement x86 assembly language.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Assembly-level code for **x86 architecture**.
- Examples covering fundamental concepts like:
  - Registers
  - Memory addressing
  - Arithmetic and logical operations
  - Control flow (loops, conditions)
  - System calls
- Practical programs demonstrating real-world use cases.

## üíª Prerequisites
To assemble and run the code in this repository, you'll need:
1. An assembler like **NASM** (Netwide Assembler).
   - Install it using:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install nasm      # On Linux
     brew install nasm          # On macOS
     ```
2. A compatible emulator or debugger like **GDB** or **QEMU** for execution and debugging.

## üöÄ Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coal.git
   cd coal
